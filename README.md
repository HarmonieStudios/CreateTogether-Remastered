# CreateTogether Remastered

An unofficial Create Together Remaster in 1.20.1.

## Description

Create Together Remastered is an unofficial remaster using 1.20.1 and has the same goals as the original, that is to be a lightweight modpack designed for breezing through the vanilla grind and focusing your time and creativity exclusively on the awesome Create mod.
This is a great modpack to pick if you're coming from vanilla, and want to see what Modded Minecraft has to offer, but also for seasoned players looking for a simple modpack with many possibilities.

This pack has been approved to be published to CurseForge by the original owners/creators: Xisuma and NillerMedDild.
Note: I am not affiliated with the Enigmatica Modpacks team, I simply have permission from the creators to make and post this pack.

Create Together is partnered with Bisect Hosting, purchasing anything from Bisect using the code create-together supports the original creators!
Bisect Hosting offers a quick, simple and high quality solution. After your purchase, the server is already configured and ready to use.

## Help

Allocate at least 3GB RAM to Minecraft.
Make sure the CurseForge App is up-to-date and can run 1.20.1 modpacks.
